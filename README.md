# ✨ Flasky Guess Fest 🎯🎉  

> A ✨mini web adventure✨ into the magical world of number guessing and GIFs!

Hey there, fellow dev or curious clicker!  
Welcome to *Flasky Guess Fest* — my first ever mini web project using *Flask*!! 🐍

This project was born during my Flask-learning journey as part of my 100 Days of Python course. I decided to turn a basic CLI number guessing game into a *full-blown, gif-powered, web-based cutie* — and now it’s alive, colorful, and totally tweakable!  

## 🎈 What’s Inside?

- A homepage with a bold <h1> that dares you to guess a number between 0 and 9  
- A *random number generator* behind the scenes picking the secret digit  
- Fun & quirky *GIFs* (you can add your own from Giphy or anywhere!)  
- ✨Tacky CSS✨ that’s meant to be changed, styled, and sparkled up!

## ⚡ Why I Built This?

Because…  
- I’m learning *Flask* and wanted to experiment!  
- I love adding ✨ personality ✨ to simple projects  
- I wanted to create a tiny customizable web framework that others can remix!

## 🔧 How to Run It

1. Clone this baby:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flasky-guess-fest.git
   cd flasky-guess-fest

2. Set up your virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows


3. Install Flask:

pip install flask


4. Run the server:

python server.py


5. Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

And be greeted by your very own funky guessing game!



# 🌈 Customize Your Fest!

You can:

Swap the GIFs (try your fav ones from giphy.com)

Change the colors, fonts, styles — make it your vibe

Add input boxes to actually guess numbers (mini challenge!)

🎯 Turn it into a full-blown game app — scoreboards, timers, leaderboards!


# 🧁 Why You Should Fork It

Because this isn’t just a game — it’s a framework to get wild and weird with web dev!
Make it spooky, make it aesthetic, make it neon — it’s all yours.

# 🎓 Learning Spotlight

Built with:

Python 3

Flask

My brain on 2 hours of sleep and 5 cups of tea ☕

A sprinkle of ✨HTML/CSS magic✨


## 🪄 Final Words

It’s messy.
It’s silly.
It’s mine.
And now — it can be yours too! Fork it, star it, remix it.
